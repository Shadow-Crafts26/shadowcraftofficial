    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>ShadowCraft was born out of a dream. A dream to bring warmth back into gifting. In a world overrun by mass-produced goods, ShadowCraft stood up to say — 'Let it be personal.' What started as a hobby in a quiet bedroom became a movement of love-driven art. From hand-cut designs to hand-painted accents, our work is our heart on display. And every product sent is a piece of our soul shared with the world.</p>
